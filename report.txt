Upon attempting to boot the machine, it comes to a screen as if it was a new user, where we are instructed to select the country setting, then the timezone.  Finally, we come to a screen saying "Welcome to Puppy Video Wizard".  This is a bad idea to use this for analysis because it is being set up like a new machine.  If we use it like a new computer, we will lose all the potential evidence.
